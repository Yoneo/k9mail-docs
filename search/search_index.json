Later we describe them in detail. Note that on a smartphone, your popped-up soft keyboard may be covering some of these entry fields; don't forget to scroll. IMAP server : This is the hostname or IP address of your IMAP server. Note that this address must resolve to your mail server no matter what network you're connected to -- if you provide a name or IP that's only resolvable inside your private network , that's the only place you'll be able to pick up email. (If you don't understand the preceding, then you probably don't need to worry about it.) Some firewalls can also cause trouble here. Security : This specifies the cryptographic protocol that should be used when connecting to your IMAP server. Available options are: None: This doesn't use any transport security at all. STARTTLS: The STARTTLS method is used. SSL/TLS: TLS is used. TLS and STARTTLS are both secure so it does not matter which you use, as long as it is supported by your mail provider. However TLS is now much more common. Port : This is the port number the IMAP server is listening on. Most of the time you don't want to change this. It will generally be: 143 for non-encrypted or STARTTLS connections, and 993 for TLS. If your port number is something else, the mail server administrator should have told you. Username : This is the username that's needed to authenticate to the IMAP server. The field is initialized with the user part of your email address. Some servers are okay with this; some, generally those which support multiple domains, require that you fill in your entire email address here. In this case, if you entered the entire email address on the previous screen, you will need to re-enter the hostname part here, as K-9 Mail doesn't know whether you need it and assumes you don't. Authentication : This specifies which authentication method to use after you have a valid, hopefully encrypted, connection. Available options are: Normal password : The password is transmitted in plain text. If the connection security is TLS or STARTTLS, the password is still protected against eavesdroppers. Encrypted password : Use this if your server doesn't support transport security but supports the CRAM_MD5 authentication method. Client certificate : Use this if the service supports authentication using the client certificate from the TLS connection. If the server requires both certificate and password, choose one of the \"Password\" options here. Password, transmitted insecurely : (Only displayed if Security is \"None\") Use only as a last resort. The password will be transmitted without any encryption. Password : Here you enter the password to access your emails. The password you entered at the first step of the account creation process is pre-entered here. So you shouldn't need to change it. This password is the one which an administrator set for you or gave to you, which you use to retrieve mail from the mailbox. Client certificate : If the server expects a TLS client certificate to be provided during the initial connection, use this to select one from the local Android certificate store. Auto-detect IMAP namespace : Disable this to allow the IMAP path prefix to be specified manually. IMAP path prefix : The content of this field is prepended to IMAP folder names before use. The main usage is to manually select which IMAP namespace to use. This can be automatically guessed, so usually, you don't need to change this. Use compression on network : If your server supports compression (DEFLATE) it is used on the selected networks to minimize the amount of data transferred. Selecting this, even if your server doesn't support compression, doesn't cause problems. So there should be no need to change these. After clicking \"Next\" K-9 Mail tries to connect to the server to verify the settings. This means you need to have a working network connection to continue the setup. If the server has an invalid certificate (e.g. self-signed) then at this point you can inspect the certificate and choose to accept it permanently.

In this step of the account creation process you have to provide those details. Below is an explanation of the different settings. In certain circumstances, you may need to use a different outgoing server than you'd expect; we'll discuss those later. Because of the nature of email service, you often (if not always, these days) send outgoing mail to one server, but pick up incoming mail from a separate one; this is why many of the items below say \"this is often, but not always, the same as the setting for incoming mail\". SMTP server : This is the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server. As discussed under IMAP , this name or IP must be accessible from any network from which you may want to send mail, whether your cellular carrier's WAN or a private LAN via Wi-Fi. See below for more details if you have trouble. Security : This specifies the cryptographic protocol that should be used when connecting to your SMTP server. Available options are: None: This doesn't use any transport security at all. SSL/TLS: TLS is used. STARTTLS: The STARTTLS method is used. TLS and STARTTLS are both secure so it does not matter which you use, as long as it is supported by your outgoing mail provider. Port : The port number your provider's SMTP is listening on. This may be 465 or 587 , and in rare cases 25 , depending on the configuration and transport security settings of your server and K-9. Require sign-in : Tells K-9 Mail whether or not it will be expected to authenticate to the server. In almost all cases this needs to remain checked. Username : The username that's needed to authenticate to the SMTP server. This is usually equal to either the left-hand side of, or the entire, email address; your mail server operator should have told you what to use as an Outgoing username -- and it will commonly be identical to the incoming username, though not always. Authentication : This specifies which authentication method to use. Available options are: Normal password : This is the default method that will automatically detect which authentication methods are supported. You shouldn't need to change this. Encrypted password : Use this if your server doesn't support transport security but supports the CRAM_MD5 authentication method. Client certificate : Use this if the service supports authentication using the client certificate from the TLS connection. If the server requires both certificate and password, choose one of the \"Password\" options here.

If the server has an invalid certificate (e.g. self-signed) then at this point you can inspect the certificate and choose to accept it permanently. Check with your mail provider before accepting the certificate, since this could indicate an attempt to tamper with your mail connection. Account options After successfully setting up the incoming and outgoing servers, you can now configure some basic settings on how often K-9 Mail checks for new messages, if you want to be notified of new mail, etc. These settings are specific to each account/mailbox you configure; you can set them differently for different mailboxes. Folder poll frequency : Here you specify in what interval K-9 Mail should check the incoming server to see if there are new messages. Available options are: Never Every 15 minutes Every 30 minutes Every hour Every 2 hours Every 3 hours Every 6 hours Every 12 hours Every 24 hours Number of messages to display : This value determines how many messages are kept locally cached and displayed. Available options are: 25 messages 50 messages 100 messages 250 messages 500 messages 1000 messages Higher values have some performance implications. See Local folder size for more information. Notify me when mail arrives : If this is checked you are notified when a new message was downloaded in this mailbox. Notification type (LED, vibration) and ringtone can be configured later. See Notifications for more information. Last step To complete the account creation you have to fill out the following two fields: Give this account a name (optional): This is the name of the account that will be displayed in the account list. If you leave this field empty the email address associated with this account will be used. Type your name : This will be used as your name for messages sent using this account. Recipients of your email will see this name.

As an open source privacy-conscious project we don't implement an always-on logging system that reports all the device's activity to a central server. While this would make issues easier to fix it would also be costly to host the server and compromise the privacy of our users. Instead we ask, if you find an issue, and are willing to help, you provide the logs yourself. We realize the procedure is currently complex and difficult on newer devices. Details Step 1: Activate Debug Logging in K-9 Mail At the accounts screen of K-9 Mail press the menu button, then choose \"Settings\" . Under the heading \"Debugging\" check the \"Enable debug logging\" checkbox. Hit the back button twice to save the changes. If K-9 is crashing, don't worry about about enabling debug logs. Step 2: Trigger error Do whatever causes the problem/error. Step 3: Get Debug Log To fetch the debug log you have to attach the device to your PC and use the tool adb from the Android SDK. Install adb and connect to your device . Find the process ID of K-9 Mail: adb shell ps -A | grep k9 The output will be similar to: u0_a153 5191 587 4468612 112380 SyS_epoll_wait 0 S com.fsck.k9.debug In this example the PID is 5191 To capture the debug log in a file named k9-log.txt , enter the command: adb logcat -d --pid=<PID> > k9-log.txt Step 4: Create an Issue in our Bug Tracker To be able to fix your problem we need to know about it. Please create a new issue in our bug tracker . Attach a copy of the debug log you just created. It's okay to remove your password from the debug log.

If so configured, K-9 uses Android's notification system to alert you to the new messages. Sync Types & K-9 Behavior There are two ways of being notified of new mail synchronized to your device, Push and Poll. \"Push\" means that the server notifies K-9 of new email. This is immediate, therefore the best choice if you want to be notified as soon as you have new mail. Unfortunately due to Android battery optimizations and unreliable networks, it does not always work. \"Poll\" means K-9 periodically checks the server to see if new mail exists. Your choice of Push or Poll applies to each Folder Class within an account, rather than at the account level. You can also manually synchronize an account. In this case, K-9 polls all subscribed folders. Various actions within K-9 may cause it to perform an additional poll to ensure that the state is consistent before/after they perform the action. Browsing E-mail At this point, you're looking at a Message List -- a list of all (or only the unread) messages in a given folder; in this case, the Inbox folder for that email account. This list displays: message subject lines (in bold if not yet read, highlighted if not fully downloaded), a time or date (depending on the age of the message), and either the sender's email address or \"real name\". It also displays by default: a short preview of the body text of the message a star icon for flagging messages These options can be enabled or disabled in Global Settings->Display->Message lists. Threads of messages are by default collapsed into a single row, which you can tap to expand to show a list of messages in that thread. If you don't like this, you can turn it off in Global Settings->Display->Message lists->Threaded view. At this point, you can: tap on a message in the list to open it for reading, or tap the contact icon on the left of the message to select one or more messages. When one or more messages are selected, actions appear in the Action Bar at the top. There is also an overflow menu, so some of the actions might require you to tap the right hand menu icon (circled below.) If you are unsure of the meaning of an icon, you can safely long-press it to show a tooltip.

Most recipient mail clients will use this email address when replying to your email, instead of the From address. To address This is automatically populated if you're replying to an email. You can type an email address into this box if you know it exactly. K-9 will simultaneously search your contacts for matching names, nicknames, and email addresses. If you choose one of the suggestions, that will replace what you have typed. To add multiple recipients, tap into the box again and start typing again. To delete a recipient, tap the recipient and then the delete button in the popup. You can also press backspace on the keyboard to delete the recipient before the cursor.

Saving as draft K-9 will save your message in the remote Drafts folder if you press the back button and choose 'Safe as Draft', or choose the 'Save as Draft' menu option. To get back to your draft message, choose the message from within the account's Draft folder. A draft is also created when you switch away from the K-9 application. Signature At the bottom of the message text the default signature is shown. This can be changed in Settings/Account Settings/Manage identities/ Identity /Signature . Read Receipt You can give your recipient the choice to send you back a 'read receipt', to indicate that they have read your email. Choose the 'Read receipt' menu option. Do not rely on read receipts, because: Not all email clients recognise read receipts. The recipient might decline to send you a read receipt. The read receipt is itself an email, which could be lost. K-9 does not send Read Receipts in the other direction, i.e. when receiving emails that request a read receipt. Encryption If the recipient's key is available, the padlock icon will be shown next to the contact name: Once you've added all recipients, to encrypt (and sign) the email, tap the padlock icon. The icon will change to green to indicate encryption will be enabled for this message. If you add another recipient whose key is not available, the encryption icon will turn red.

From Settings, each account's settings can be reached from the account list by tapping the account name: (The = sign on the right of each account lets you drag the account up or down to change the display order.) General Settings Account name Here you can specify the name of the account that is displayed in the account list screen. Account color Here you can select the color that is used to indicate that a particular message (or folder) belongs to the selected account. Reading mail Always show images This setting allows you to control when images are automatically downloaded and displayed in the message view and when you have to press the Show pictures button first. Available options: No (Always display the Show pictures button) From contacts (Display images automatically if the sender is in your Contacts) From anyone (Never display the Show pictures button) Mark as read when opened Check this to mark messages as read when you open them (the default). Independent of what you select here, you can always select Mark as read or Mark unread from the menu when viewing a message. Fetching mail These settings control how and when mail is fetched for this account. Local folder size Specify the number of messages that will be downloaded for a folder. When new messages are downloaded older messages will be deleted from the device (but not from the server). This is no hard limit and you can download more messages by pressing Load up to XX more at the end of the message list. Sync messages from If you set this to anything other than any time (no limit) , K-9 Mail will only download messages that are newer than a certain time span. During synchronization K-9 Mail will remove previously downloaded messages that fall outside that range from the device (but not the server). Note: Currently, pressing Load up to XX more in the message list doesn't override this setting. That means you won't be able to manually fetch messages older than specified here. Note: This setting is only available for IMAP accounts. Fetch messages up to Set a limit on how much of a message is downloaded during synchronization. When viewing messages larger than this value you will see a button saying Download complete message that allows you to download the rest of the message. Folder poll frequency Control the poll frequency from \"never\" (do not poll at all), up to 24 hours. Poll folders Control whether to poll all, 1st Class, 2nd Class or no folders at all. To learn more about this, read the page Folder classes . Push folders Control whether to push all, 1st class, 2nd class or no folders. To learn more about this, read the page Folder classes . Note: This setting is only available for IMAP accounts, because it's the only account type that supports Push. Sync server deletions By default K-9 Mail removes downloaded messages from the device if the message has been deleted from the server. If you uncheck this setting K-9 Mail will keep the downloaded messages. Mark as read when deleted Self-explanatory. When I delete a message You can control what happens when you delete a message using K-9 Mail. The following options are available: Do not delete on server (only from the device) Delete from server Mark as read on server (not available for POP3 accounts) Erase deleted messages on server Normally, messages on the server are simply marked for deletion. Here you can control when they are actually deleted (expunged). Available options: Immediately When polling Manually Note: Some clients can display messages that are marked for deletion and allow you to remove that flag, undeleting them. K-9 Mail currently doesn't support that functionality. Note: This setting is only available for IMAP accounts. Incoming server Please see Incoming Server Settings for the available settings. Advanced K-9 Mail supports some advanced settings for IMAP accounts. If you're not familiar with the details of the IMAP protocol you shouldn't change any of these settings. Poll when connecting for push When this is enabled, K-9 Mail will do a full folder synchronization after establishing a Push connection. Otherwise it will only download new messages. Max folders to check with push K-9 Mail needs to establish one connection for each folder that is checked via Push. This can quickly add up and exceed the number of concurrent connections your mail server allows you to establish. This setting is intended as safety mechanism to limit the number of Push connections regardless of how many folders are configured to be checked via Push. Refresh IDLE connection This controls how often K-9 refreshes the IDLE connection used in Push. In theory this should never be necessary but sometimes networks break the connection, causing you to miss notifications. Lowering the value here will mitigate that problem, at the cost of reduced battery life. Sending mail These settings control everything related to sending mail. Composition defaults Here you can configure your main identity. Your name This is the name that will be used in outgoing messages. Your email address This is the email address that will be used as the sending address for outgoing messages. Bcc all messages to Here you enter an email address that will receive a copy of all messages you send. Use signature Enable this to add a signature to all your messages. Signature Enter the signature text here. Note: You should start the signature with \"-- \" (dash, dash, space) on its own line. Most email clients will recognize this as start of the signature and e.g. allow stripping the signature when quoting messages in replies. Signature position Here you can specify where your signature should appear when replying to a message. Available options are: Before quoted text (your text, your signature, quoted text) After quoted text (your text, quoted text, your signature) Note: This setting will be ignored if you check the setting Reply after quoted text . Manage identities Here you can set up alternative identities consisting of name, email address, Reply-to address, and signature. At first it will show a list with the single \"initial identity\". Use the menu in the top right to add another: Delete an identity Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities, then select Remove . Set default identity Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities to open a menu that allows you to change the order of identities ( Move up , Move down , Move to top / make default ). The top-most identity is the default identity that will be used when composing a message from this account. Message Format Here you can configure the message format that is used for outgoing messages. The following options are available: Plain text (you will lose all formatting and inline images of the original message when forwarding/replying to a message; this will only send text/plain parts) HTML (keeps images and formatting; will additionally include a text/plain part) Automatic (same as Plain text when composing new messages; same as HTML when replying or forwarding messages) Always show Cc/Bcc Enabling this will always show the text fields to specify CC and BCC recipients in the message composition screen. Read receipt Checking this requests a read receipt for all outgoing messages. See Editing E-mail Content/Read Receipt for more information. Reply quoting style Defines your preference for the format in which the quoted text of the message you are replying to will appear from the following options: Prefix (like Gmail) - The quoted text appears below a one line header in the format Sender's Name <user@domain.TLD> wrote: . With the prefix option selected 2 additional options are available: Reply after quoted text - When enabled, the original message appears above the reply you type into the message text box. Quoted text prefix - Defines the character(s) that precedes each line of quoted text. The default is '>'. Header (like Outlook) - The quoted text appears below a header that includes the Original Sender, Recipients, Time, and Subject from the original email's message header fields. Quote message when replying Uncheck this if by default you don't want to include the original message in your reply. You will still be able to include the original message by clicking the Quote message button in the message composition screen when replying to a message. Strip signatures on reply When this is enabled, K-9 Mail will try to detect the correspondent's signature and remove it when quoting the original message. Upload sent messages Upload sent messages to your account's Sent folder if the send was successful. Outgoing server Please see Configuring the outgoing server for the available settings. Folders Auto-expand folder The folder you specify here will be opened when you select an account in the drawer. When this option is set to NONE , opening an account via the drawer will leave the drawer open and display the folder list of that account, allowing you to select a folder. Folders to display Here you can specify what folder classes should be displayed in the folder list. This can also be changed from the Show folders... sub-menu in the Manage Folders settings. For details of this option see Folder classes . Move/copy destination folders This setting specifies which folders are displayed when you're asked to pick a destination folder for copy and move operations. Available options are: All Only 1st Class folders 1st and 2nd Class folders All except 2nd Class folders To learn more about folder classes, read the page Folder classes . Folders to search Here you specify what folders are searched when you start a search from the folder list or the account list. Searches from a message list only search messages in that list. Available options are: All Displayable (only folders matching Folders to display ) None Archive folder Here you can designate an archive folder. Messages will be moved there when the Archive action is used. Selecting -NONE- disables the archive functionality for this account. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Drafts folder This specifies which folder is used to save message drafts. Select NONE to disable saving drafts. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Sent folder A copy of sent messages is uploaded to this folder. Select NONE to disable this functionality. Please note that your mail server might save a copy of outgoing messages regardless. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Spam folder Here you can designate a spam folder. Messages will be moved there when the Spam action is used. Selecting NONE disables this functionality. Please note that K-9 Mail does not have a spam filter included. Moving messages to a special spam folder will often train the spam filter on your mail server. If your server doesn't support this, you might as well disable this functionality and just delete messages. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Trash folder Messages you delete in K-9 Mail are moved to the folder you specify here. If you select -NONE- K-9 Mail will delete messages instead of moving them to a trash folder. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Notifications Here you can specify whether and how you want to be notified of certain events. New mail notifications Enable this if you want K-9 Mail to notify you when new (unread) messages have been downloaded. Notification folders K-9 Mail will only create notifications for messages in folders whose notification class matches this setting. Include outgoing mail If this is unchecked K-9 Mail will not create notifications for downloaded messages that were sent by an address from one of your configured identities. Contacts only Check this to limit notifications to messages from known contacts. Ignore chat messages If you're using an email chat app like Delta Chat , you probably want to disable notifications for chat messages. Otherwise you might end up with notifications for the same message from both apps. New mail ringtone Select a notification sound. Vibration Here you can configure a vibration pattern for notifications. There are multiple patterns available. A pattern can be repeated up to 10 times. Note: Even with this setting unchecked a notification can cause a vibration when you've configured a ringtone and your device is switched to vibrate. This is controlled by Android, not K-9 Mail. Notification light Notifications for new messages can blink the notification light in a particular color. The available options are: * Disabled * Account color * System default color * White * Red * Green * Blue * Yellow * Cyan * Magenta Note: Not all devices have a notification light. Unfortunately, there is no way for an app to find out if that's the case. So this setting is always visible, even when you can't use it. Sync notifications If this is enabled, K-9 Mail will display a notification in the status bar as long as it is checking for new mail. Notification categories On Android 8 and above a notification needs to belong to a notification category that users can individually configure or disable entirely. Messages This will open the system screen to configure notifications for new messages in this account. Miscellaneous This will open the system screen to configure miscellaneous notifications, like error notifications and the sync notification. Note: You should never disable all notifications in this category. Otherwise you might miss important error notifications. If you only want to get rid of sync notifications, use the Sync notifications setting instead. Search In this section you can enable and configure the behavior of server-side search. Note: This is only available for IMAP accounts. Server search limit Here you can specify how many search results are downloaded. K-9 Mail will only download the headers of found messages. The message contents are only downloaded after the message is opened for viewing. Available options are: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, All. End-to-end encryption This section allows you to select a cryptography provider that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the OpenPGP standard. Note: Currently only OpenKeychain is supported as a crypto provider. Check the PGP/MIME section for details on how to use it. OpenPGP Provider This allows you to select the crypto provider to use. Right now the only options are None , APG and OpenKeychain Auto-sign Enable this if you want to sign all messages sent with K-9 Mail. You will still be able to override this on a case-by-case basis in the screen to compose a message. Auto-encrypt Enable this if you want to encrypt all messages sent to a contact you have a public key for.

To this end, there are settings to be made on both Account and Folders. If you do not make any Class setting changes, K-9 will display all of your folders, but will only synchronize your inbox folder. Assigning classes Classes can be used to adjust both the display of your folders and the automatic synchronization. Only displayed folders will be synchronized, irrespective of the synchronization class settings. You can adjust the Account Class settings through Account Settings . To adjust the folder Class settings, use Folder Settings . Folder display class First is the Folder display class . A folder can be assigned to be in 1st Class , 2nd Class or None . The default is None . If you have a lot of folders, and only want to display a few, then assign those few to 1st Class . If you have a lot of folders, and only want to hide a few, assign those few to 2nd Class , and leave the rest set to None . Folder sync class Second, it is also possible to separately set the \"Folder sync class\". By default, the folder's sync class is the same as the folder's display class. However, there are cases in which it is useful to have a different class for synchronization purposes. For instance, if there is a folder that you want to appear in your normal short list, but you do not want it to be automatically synced. Drafts is a good example of such a folder. In this case, assign the Drafts folder to be 1st Class for display but 2nd Class for sync. You will always have it in your folder list, but will not waste any battery power automatically keeping it in sync. Modes To make use of the folder Class assignment, you must adjust two or three settings in the \"Account settings\": \"Folders -> Folders to display\", and \"Fetching mail -> Poll [or Push] Folders\". Display mode Folders to display determines which folders are to be displayed. There are four choices: All : All folders are displayed. Only 1st Class folders : Only folders that were explicitly set to be 1st Class for their \"display class\" are shown. 1st and 2nd Class folders : Only folders that were explicitly set to be either 1st Class or 2nd Class for their \"display class\" are shown. All except 2nd Class folders : All folders are shown, except those that are selected to be in 2nd Class for their display class. Sync mode There are two methods of syncing folders in K-9, see Sync Types & K-9 Behavior . The relevant menu option to choose the sync mode is called either \"Poll folders\" or \"Push folders\", under the \"Fetching mail\" menu. The below options are applicable to both methods, to determine which folders are to be automatically synchronized. There are four choices: All : All displayed folders are automatically synchronized. Only 1st Class folders : Only displayed folders that were explicitly set to be 1st Class for their \"sync class\" are automatically synchronized 1st and 2nd Class folders : Only displayed folders that were explicitly set to be either 1st Class or 2nd Class for their \"sync class\" are automatically synchronized. All except 2nd Class folders : All displayed folders, except those that are selected to be in 2nd Class for their \"sync class\", are automatically synchronized. Examples To show the utility of the various modes, it is probably best to show some use cases. In all cases, I have four folders available: Inbox, Janet, Carl and John. Use case 1: Just a few folders I want to see just my Inbox, Janet and Carl folders, and want all of those to be automatically synchronized. (Imagine I have 100 other folders that I do not want to see.)

However, if you switched to displaying all folders, K-9 would then automatically sync all folders, which might be time consuming and battery draining. Use case 2: All but a few folders I want to see and sync all of the folders, except for Carl. (Imagine I have 100 other folders I want to see.) Setting Account Inbox Janet Carl John Display mode/class All except 2nd Class Folders None None 2nd Class None Sync mode/class All except 2nd Class Folders Same as display class Same as display class Same as display class Same as display class Use case 3: A few folders, only some automatically synchronized I want to see only my Inbox, Carl and John folders, but I do not want the Carl folder to be automatically synchronized.

Most of them define how the user interface looks. Display The Display settings control the global appearance of the app, as well as each of the main views, such as the account list, message lists and message display. Global Language By default K-9 Mail displays the user interface in the language you're using for your Android system. With this setting you can override the system language, e.g. if your Android version doesn't support your native language but K-9 Mail does. Theme Available themes: Light Dark Use system default Fixed message theme When using the dark theme messages can look wrong. This is why K-9 Mail allows you to override the app theme. Enabling this setting means K-9 always uses the theme configured in Message view theme below for the message view. Not using a fixed message theme means you can select a theme in the menu of the message view. Message view theme This setting specifies the theme that is used for the message view. Available settings: Light Dark Use app theme (default) Composer theme This setting specifies the theme that is used when composing a message. Available settings: Light Dark Use app theme (default) Font size K-9 allows you to configure the font-size for various sections of the app. The \"Message body\" slider is a percentage, default 100%. Animation Currently this only affects the animation when switching from the message list to the message view and back. Account List Show Unified Inbox This shows the Unified Inbox as the first item in the main application drawer. (Enabled by default) Show starred count Each folder and account always shows the count of unread messages. This option shows also the count of starred messages. Message lists Preview Lines Configures how many lines of each message to show when previewing them in a list. More preview lines mean fewer messages can be shown at any one time. Show stars If you do not \"star\" messages you can disable the icon here to save space. Show correspondent names Disable this to display email addresses instead of correspondent names. Correspondent above subject Show correspondent names above the subject line, rather than below it. Show contact names If contacts are found in Android's Contacts, enabling this means that K-9 shows the name from there instead of from the email itself. Colorize contacts Here you can select the color to use for correspondent names from your Contacts. All other correspondents will be displayed in the default color. Only available when \"Show contact names\", above, is selected. Contact name color Choice of colour for the above option \"Colorize contacts\". Show contact pictures Disable this if you don't want to display contact pictures (or place holder images) in the message list. Colorize missing contact pictures If this is checked the place holder images for correspondents with missing contact pictures or ones not in your Contacts will be displayed in different colors. If this is disabled the images will be displayed with a grey background. Change colour when read Self-explanatory. Threaded view Threaded view is enabled by default and groups messages that belong to the same thread. Currently only messages in the same folder are grouped. Specifically, this will not include messages sent by you if those messages are not also stored in the current folder. Please note that this is not the same as the conversation view you might know from e.g. Gmail. To add own messages in threaded view: change Sent folder to INBOX in Folder settings under Account settings . Note: your own messages will no longer be stored (and synced) in the Sent folder. Show split-screen This setting allows you to display the message list next to the message view. This is mainly useful for devices with a large screen, i.e. tablets. Available settings: Always Never When in Landscape orientation Messages Fixed-width fonts When this is checked a fixed-width font will be used for plain text messages. The display of HTML messages is not influenced by this setting. Visible message actions Configure which message actions will be promoted to the first level of the menu in the message view. Note: Checking an item doesn't mean that this action will be displayed in the action bar. There is only a limited number of actions that will be displayed in the action bar, the rest will move to the so called overflow menu that is accessible using the icon with the three dots. Auto-fit message Enable this to shrink messages to fit the screen width. Interaction Volume key navigation Here you can specify whether you want to use the hardware volume keys to move up and down in the message list, or move to the previous and next message in the message view. Return to list after delete When this setting is enabled deleting a message in the message view will return to the message list rather than moving to the previous/next message. Show next message after delete Enabling this setting always moves to the next message after deleting a message from the message view. When it is disabled you move to the next or previous message depending on your previous travel direction. Confirm actions Here you can specify which actions should display a confirmation dialog. You can enable confirmations for the following actions: Delete (in message view) Delete Starred (in message view) Delete (from notification) Spam Discard message Mark all messages as ready Notifications Only some options relating to notifications are shown here. Most of the settings for notifications are under Account Settings , which means you can choose different notification styles for each account. Quiet Time You can set a Quiet Time to prevent notification from disturbing your sleep. Disable notifications Completely disables notifications during Quiet Time. Quiet Time starts Here you can specify the time when notifications will be disabled. Quiet Time ends This time specifies the end of the Quiet Time , when notifications will be enabled again. Show 'Delete' button K-9 Mail supports deleting messages directly from a notification. The available settings are: Never For single message notifications Always (default) Lock Screen Notifications Here you can configure how notifications for new messages are displayed when the device is locked. The available options are: No lock screen notifications Application name New message count (default) Message count and senders Same as when screen unlocked Network Background sync This setting specifies when K-9 Mail is allowed to synchronize messages in the background. Available settings are: When 'Auto-sync' is checked (see below) Always Never (This disables mail checking for all accounts regardless of the account settings) 'Auto-sync' is an Android-wide setting that controls accounts that link to the device. Currently K-9 email accounts do not function in this way. However setting this will make the app reflect the general auto-sync setting. The configuration of Android's Auto-sync setting may vary depending on your device's Android version and device manufacturer. On stock Android it's found under: \"Settings -> Users & accounts -> Automatically sync data\" Google provide information about auto-sync and Nexus phones Samsung provide instructions for their S6 phones. On a technical level this is the result from ContentResolver.getMasterSyncAutomatically() Privacy Hide mail client Select this option if you don't want your recipients to know you're using K-9. Note, there may be other ways for them to work it out. Hide timezone Select this option if you don't want your recipients to know your timezone. Debugging Enable debug logging Here you enable the logging of extra diagnostic information \u2013 e.g. if you're working with a developer to troubleshoot a problem. See the page on logging errors for more information. Remember to disable debug logging once it's no longer required.
